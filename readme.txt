# There is an urgent and serious need to schedule interviews for 30 different candidates in just one week. Unfortunately I cannot schedule 30 interviews in one week and deliver a productive outcome for anyone involved.
Someone is forcing me to thou, so I  would like to find some sort of compromise.

If you can help me deliver at least a portion of this impossible schedule please get back to me ASAP and allow me to be at least one less than 30 behind. Thank you!
